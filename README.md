# Technical Assessment


In this technical assessment, three approaches to solve the problem at had are provides and compared.

**The nearest neighbor Heuristic**: It is a heuristic-based greedy approach where I choose the nearest neighbor vertex at each iteration. This approach is computationally inexpensive, but it does not provide the guarantee of an optimal solution. Heuristic algorithms usually provide near-optimal solutions.

**The brute force approach: ** It is a na√Øve method. I calculate the cost of all possible valid paths and then compare them. It is computationally very expensive.

**Exact Algorithm - Dynamic programming: ** It provides exact (optimal) solutions.  It is relatively more expensive than the greedy approaches.
